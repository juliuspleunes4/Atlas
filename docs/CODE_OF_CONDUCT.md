Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

- Project documentation
- Community forums and chat channels
- Official project social media accounts

This Code of Conduct also applies when an individual is officially representing the project in public spaces.

## Enforcement

### Reporting

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the project maintainers responsible for enforcement via:

- GitHub repository issues (for public violations)
- Direct message to repository maintainers (for sensitive matters)
